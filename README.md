Hello! Welcome to Mealprepper

Mealprepper takes in ingredients that you have in your cabinet, and creates a couple of high protein recipes designed specifically with the ingredients you have provided! As an avid gymgoer, I hope this can be an easy way for people to get into mealprepping who may have little to no cooking experience. This format of utilizing an LLM is also much easier for those who may not be familiar with technology such as those who are too young or too old. 

In terms of actual features, the frontend utilizes Typescript and CSS. There isn't exactly the best mobile support, although the website will still function on mobile. In terms of backend, there are API calls to mainly openai's api to prompt the LLM with my specially crafted prompt (creating this prompt needed some prompt engineering). The output also has to be parsed with precision to provide the user with an accurate representation of the recipe. The website is deployed on vercel, and link will be down below. 

I am pretty inexperienced in terms of web development since besides the last Spark application I submitted I've never touched web dev. However, I do have experience in LLM prompt engineering as well as utilizing LLM's and their API. I did use chatgpt for a lot of the CSS code as I am very inexperienced in that regard. This took me about 20 hours total to complete.
